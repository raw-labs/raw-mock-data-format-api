  title: Generate CSV data using hard-coded inline string.
  description: Builds a CSV payload containing project information, including project details, team members, deadlines, and budgets. This method involves hardcoding the entire CSV data as a single string, including all records and fields, and then parsing this string into individual records and columns using PostgreSQL's string manipulation functions. The CSV data is treated as a single text blob that needs to be split and structured within the query.
