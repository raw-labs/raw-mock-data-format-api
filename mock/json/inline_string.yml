  title: Generate JSON data using hard-coded inline string.
  description: Builds a JSON payload containing project information, including project details, team members, deadlines, and budgets. This method involves hardcoding the entire JSON data as a single string and then parsing this string into individual JSON records and fields using PostgreSQL's string manipulation and JSON functions. The JSON string is treated as a bulk text blob that needs to be split and structured within the SQL query.
