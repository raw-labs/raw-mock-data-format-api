  title: Generate JSON data programmatically using PostgreSQL's JSON functions and filter by team member name.
  description: Builds a JSON payload containing project information, including project details, team members, deadlines and budgets, based on the provided team member name. This method involves programmatically building JSON structures using PostgreSQL's JSON functions such as json_build_object and json_build_array. Each JSON object and array is explicitly constructed within the SQL query, allowing for a structured and hierarchical representation of the data. Dynamic filtering is supported using a query parameter.
